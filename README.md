# Consent Test

It's just a small dashboard simulating a Consent Dashboard

All data is mocked and no actual database is used

## Running it

You can see the project running at <https://testconsent.netlify.app/>

You can also run it locally by cloning this project into your local computer

Once doing that and navigating inside the folder run `yarn` and `yarn dev`

### Reminder

I want to remind you that there is no database and all data is mocked, using browser memory
